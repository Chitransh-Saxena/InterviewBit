-> What is recursion?
    -> Any method calling itself is called recursion

-> In a method, there could be multiple recursions, but for now let's assume only single recursion is happening.
-> So, how do we calculate the Time Complexity?
    -> Find the number of function calls that are going to happen (how many times the recursive function would be called)
    -> Find the time complexity of each function call, apart from the next recursive call.
    -> So, for example there are N function calls and each call takes O(N^2).
        -> So, the time complexity of the recursive function would be N*O(N^2);

-> What if we have 2 recursion calls. Then how is time complexity going to be calculated.
    -> Dry running the case.
    -> We start with only 1 function call.
        -> This, in turn calls the same function 2 times.
            -> Now these 2 functions recursively call the function 2 times again (total 4 times)
                -> ....
    
    -> So, if we try to get a mathematical pattern here.
        -> At level 1, function is called 2^0 times.
        -> At level 2, function is called 2^1 times.
        -> At level 3, function is called 2^2 times.
        ...
        -> At level n, function is called 2^(n+1) times.
    
    -> So, what would be the sum of all those levels?
        -> 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^(n+1)
        -> This is sum of GP and it should come somewhere around 2^(n+2)
        -> This can be rounded off to 2^n as we are talking about Big O notation and not typical mathematics.
