Difference between Collections and Arrays

* Arrays are fixed in size, collections are growable
* If memory size is not clear, collections should be used
* Arrays are better for performance because, collections internally do a 'copy' operation when a new element out of the size bound is inserted.
* Array can only hold only homogenous data, Collections can hold both.
* Arrays do not have underlying data structure support (like methods), collections have
* Arrays can hold both primitive data types and objects, Collections can only hold objects.


Collection Framework

* It is a group of classes and interfaces which can be used to represent a group of objects as a single entity.
* Collection is different. This is used to represent a single type of collection. Like container in C++.
* So, in terms of analogy, STL = Collection framewrok and Container = Collection.
