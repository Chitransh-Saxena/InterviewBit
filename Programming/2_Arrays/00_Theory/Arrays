What is an array and how does it work internally

* Array is collection of similar data types
* If we define an array of type "Integer", we cannot add a string to it.
* int[] arr = new int[5];       // RHS is the object and LHS is the reference variable
* int[] arr = {1,2,3,4};


* int arr; // This is declaration of the array. It is null, not pointing to any memory as of now
* arr = new int[5]; // This is initialization of the array. Object is being created here. NOT contigous allocation. That only happens in C/C++.
* each item of the array can be accessed via the index. Index is basically numerical position of elements.
* Empty array of type 'int' will have the value '0' by default.
* But empty array of non-primitive type like Integer and String will have the value 'null' by default.
