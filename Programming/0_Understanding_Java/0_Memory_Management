* Static and Heap memory
    -> Stack memory contains the 'reference variables' and 'primitive data types'
    -> Heap memory contains the actual data or the 'objects'
* Garbage Collection
    * When there is no reference variable pointing to some 'object', that object becomes eligible for gargage collection.

* Intro
-> a = 10;
    -> Here, a is 'reference variable' here
    -> and 10 is the object.
    -> a is not the object.

-> So, 'a' is stored in stack, and that a is storing the memory address of a block in 'heap' where the value 10 is stored.
